# DestinationHome
Public repo for college project Unity top-down shooter "Destination: Home", name still work in progress.

Project description:
Destionation: Home is a top down shooter that mixes CQC combat with sci-fi ship combat and adds the strategic element of managing your resources as you travel the galaxy on your way back home.
The game starts with giving the player a very limited set of resources. Use the resources you have to travel to new levels, acquire new resources and ultimately stockpile and upgrade enough to face the longest path of them all: the path home.
Raid and scavenge for supplies as you jump from system to system. Rummage through the debris fields of commercial ships, fend off pirates, land on asteroids, desolate space stations and perhaps even meet lifeforms unknown to mankind.
Find (or craft) upgrades and consumables you will need to survive in the harsh void of outer space.
Get aboard the most dangerous "Are we there yet?" trip you have ever seen and prepare to get back home.
